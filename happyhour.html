       <div class="review">One thing that I love about living in New York is that it’s like dancing. There is a physical and spiritual rhythm to the place, and if you move here with no real ties, you must let the city lead as you dance with it. Otherwise you’ll get frustrated with its dissonance.
Happy Hour by Marlowe Granados is a perfect illustration of dancing with New York. Two friends move to the city with no jobs. They hop from random gig to random gig and night out to night out as they take one step of the dance at a time. They find men at bars to pay for their drinks.
