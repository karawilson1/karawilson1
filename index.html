    <h1>Welcome to my website FOR FUN!!!!</h1>
    <p>You can also visit<a href="https://www.karawilsondesign.com"> my actual website</a> to view all my projects. This is just a lil playground for me to practice writing code. Originally I was learning Javascript but turns out HTML is waaaaaaaay easier (that's what we have here for all you non-coders). One day I'll be a Javascript girly, but not today. Today is for one small thing done well, and that's gonna be HTML. You can call me HTML girly 4 now</p>
    
    <p2>Thanks for visiting. I know there's not much to see, but it means a lot that you stopped by.</p2>
    <p3>~~~~I AM A WOMAN IN STEM~~~~</p3>
    <p4>Blessings and adulations,</p4>
