     <h2>  Hello! I am a product designer, visual designer, and former 5th grade teacher based in <a class="highlight"><i>New York.</i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/IMG_2930.JPG"></div></a></h2>
     <h2>  I love seeing the different forms of information design coming out of the publishing world that make people think and explore the subject further. I would love to find a role that would allow me to engage with the multiplicities of web and app design through coding, motion graphics, and data.</h2>
