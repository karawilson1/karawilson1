      <h2>  Hello! I am a <a class="highlight"><i>digital product designer,</i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/nyt collections.gif"></div></a> <a class="highlight"><i>visual designer,</i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/Utopia+Poster+Mockup (1).png"></div></a> and former 5th grade teacher based in <a class="highlight"><i>New York. </i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/IMG_2930.JPG"></div></a>I am currently pursuing my master's degree in communication design at Parsons.</h2>
      <h2>  I created this space to make room for a less-stuffy, more-comprehensive view of who I am and what I value; if you'd like to see my design work, there's a button over there in the top right corner that will take you there. But if you'd like to stick around and hang out, that works too!</h2>
      <h3><u>A couple things:</u></h3>
      <h2>  I used to be a 5th grade teacher. I left teaching in 2019 because I realized that my strengths were not oriented for direct instruction. How I understand the world is not tethered to anything physical; my worldview, which is constantly shifting, comes to me in the space between words, the precision of the language used around me, and how ideas are transmitted from one person to another. I like professionally exploring my worldview through design because the design process feels similar to how my brain works: concentric and iterative.</h2> 
     <h2> Professionally, I feel most energized when exploring the nonlinear and expansive parts of a project and digging deeper into the edgy details; I love creating things that energize people to explore the world at the ground level, meaning, I like when people can see their own ideas, habits, and interests in what I create.</h2>
      <h2>  I’m a big fan of the different examples of <a class="highlight"><i>information design</i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/gl_nyt_01.jpg"></div></a> coming out of the editorial world that make people think about and explore subjects further. I also enjoy opportunities to infuse my work with a playful and intentional voice that makes the user feel personally seen by and engaged with it, because we need more of that on the world wide web!<a class="highlight"><i>If you're interested or hiring, I would love to find a role</i><div><img class="hidden2" src="docs/KaraWilsonResume2021.png"></div></a> that would allow me to engage with the multiplicities of UX/UI design through words- and ideas-centric digital products.</h2>
