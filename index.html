     <h1>Kara Wilson</h1>
     <h2>  Hello! I am a product designer, visual designer, and former 5th grade teacher based in <a class="highlight"><i>New York. </i></a>I am currently pursuing my master's degree in communication design at Parsons.</h2>
     <h2>  I love seeing the different forms of <a class="highlight"><i>information design</i><div></a> coming out of the publishing world that make people think about and explore subjects further. I would love to find a role that would allow me to engage with the multiplicities of UX/UI design through coding, motion graphics, and data.</h2>
