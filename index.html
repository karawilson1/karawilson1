        <p>I'm so glad you're here. This is just a lil playground for me to practice writing code.</p>
        <p>I like to call myself a woman in STEM, you see. It took me 6 hours to figure out how to make this little website, and honestly I'm still not sure what I clicked correctly after 12 billion permutations of the same actions, but here we are! It also cost $20 for this domain so I better get my money's worth. Share this link with your friends! Write it in spray paint over a stop sign! Type it out on a piece of paper and put the piece of paper into a glass bottle and then throw the bottle into the ocean, preferably over the side of a large ocean liner that's setting sail in 1870 while crowds of people <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftenor.com%2Fview%2Fwave-hi-excited-giddy-enthusiastic-gif-11653331&psig=AOvVaw17sxS54YE32cY9POKFUbv7&ust=1610896548611000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCIiyiLffoO4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAI">wave furiously</a> from ashore! Whatever it takes to get the word out about this <b>AMAZING, DYNAMIC</b> creation of mine because, like I said, $20 and 6 precious hours of my incredibly valuable time.</p> 
        <p>I have absolutely no idea how to check traffic on this thing, and also haven't gotten to the mastery point in Javascript where I know how to implement an input/output function in this environment in order to check attendance, so I am either talking to 0 people right now and laughing only with myself or there is some sort of audience out there in the ether. So if you're reading this <strike>it's too late</strike>, <b>give me a sign</b>. Incidentally, this site doubles as a ouija board.</p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting. I know there's not much to see, but it means a lot that you stopped by. One day it will look better, and then you'll be able to say you got to see the ugly phase of the lil guy. To whom would you say this? No idea.</p>
