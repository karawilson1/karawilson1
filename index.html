     <h1>Hello! I am a product designer, visual designer, and former 5th grade teacher based in <a class="hidden" src="docs/IMG_2930.JPG">New York</a>. I love looking at the different forms of information design coming out of the publishing world, and I would love to find a role that would allow me to explore and engage with the multiplicities of web and app design, including coding, motion graphics, and data.</h1>
