    <h1>HEY!!! Welcome to my website FOR FUN!!!!</h1>
    <p>You can also visit<a href="https://www.karawilsondesign.com"> my actual website</a> to view all my projects. This is just a lil playground for me to practice writing code. I like to call myself a woman in STEM, you see. It took me 6 hours to figure out how to make this website, and honestly I still am not sure what I clicked correctly after 12 billion permutations of the same actions, but here we are! It also cost $20 for this domain so I better get my money's worth. Share this link with your friends! Write it in spray paint over a stop sign! Write it on a piece of paper and put the piece of paper into a glass bottle and then throw the bottle into the ocean! Whatever it takes to get the word out about this AMAZING creation of mine because, like I said, $20 and 6 precious hours of my highly-valuable time.</p>
    
    <p2>Thanks for visiting. I know there's not much to see, but it means a lot that you stopped by.</p2>
    <p3>~~~~I AM A WOMAN IN STEM~~~~</p3>
