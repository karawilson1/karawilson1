      <h2>  Hello! I am a <a class="highlight"><i>digital product designer,</i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/nyt collections.gif"></div></a> <a class="highlight"><i>visual designer,</i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/Utopia+Poster+Mockup (1).png"></div></a> and former 5th grade teacher based in <a class="highlight"><i>New York. </i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/IMG_2930.JPG"></div></a>I am currently pursuing my master's degree in communication design at Parsons.</h2>
      <h2>  I created this personal website with the intent to have a more honest place to talk about who I am, personally and professionally; if you'd like to see my design work, there's a button over there in the top right corner that will take you there. But if you'd like to stick around and hang out, that works too!</h2>
      <h2>  A little bit about me that you won't find on my website:</h2>
      <h2>  I used to be a 5th grade teacher. I left teaching in 2019 because I realized that my strengths were not suited for direct instruction. How I understand the world is not tethered to anything physical; my worldview, which is constantly shifting, comes to me in the space between words, the precision of the language used around me, and how I am able to visualize a what people mean when they talk. You may see now how this wouldn't translate to a classroom of 5th graders. I like exploring my concentric and iterative worldview through design.</h2> 
     <h2> I feel most energized when exploring the nonlinear and expansive parts of a project and digging deeper into the edgy details; I love creating things that energize people to explore the world at the ground level, meaning, I like to share my delight in how I see the world.</h2>
      <h2>  I’m a big fan of the different examples of <a class="highlight"><i>information design</i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/gl_nyt_01.jpg"></div></a> coming out of the editorial world that make people think about and explore subjects further. I also enjoy opportunities to infuse my work with a playful and intentional voice that makes the user feel personally seen by and engaged with it.<a class="highlight"><i> I would love to find a role</i><div><img class="hidden2" src="docs/KaraWilsonResume2021.png"></div></a> that would allow me to engage with the multiplicities of UX/UI design.</h2>
