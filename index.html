      <h3>Hello &mdash;</h3>
      <h3>I am a digital product designer, visual designer, and former 5th grade teacher in New York City. I have a Master's degree in communication design from Parsons.<h3>
<h3>I love creating things that energize people to explore the world at the ground level, especially if that exploration leads to learning something new or shifting an existing worldview. I feel most energized thinking about how to design for words, stories, and ideas and what that means for the current moment and medium.<h3>
