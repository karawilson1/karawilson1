      <h2>  Hello üëãüèº I am a <a class="highlight"><i>digital product designer,</i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/nyt collections.gif"></div></a> <a class="highlight"><i>visual designer,</i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/Utopia+Poster+Mockup (1).png"></div></a> and former 5th grade teacher based in <a class="highlight"><i>New York. </i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/IMG_2930.JPG"></div></a>I am currently pursuing my master's degree in communication design at Parsons.</h2>
      <h2>  I created this space to make room for a less-stuffy, more-comprehensive view of who I am and what I value; if you'd like to see my design work, there's a <a class="highlight"><i>button over there</i><div><img class="hidden2" src="arrow.jpg"></div></a> in the top right corner that will take you to that room of the internet. But if you'd like to stick around and hang out, I'd love to have you!</h2>

      <h2>  I used to be a 5th grade teacher. I left teaching in 2019 because I realized that my strengths were not oriented toward direct instruction; I am too contemplative and enthralled with details to teach from a 30,000-foot curriculum. How I see + understand the world is constantly shifting, and my own point of view reveals itself to me in the space between words, the precision of the language used around me, and how ideas are transmitted from one person to another. I like professionally exploring my worldview through design because the design process feels similar to how my brain works: receptive, concentric, iterative, fluid. My time as a teacher was not a waste, though; it taught me how to plan and package an experience for an audience and how to make sure that experience was on a firm foundation of research and data.</h2> 
      <h2>  As a designer, I feel most energized when exploring the nonlinear and expansive parts of a project and digging deeper into the edgy details; I love creating things that energize people to explore the world at the ground level, meaning, I like when people can see their own ideas, habits, and interests in what I create.</h2>
      <h2>  I‚Äôm a big fan of the different examples of <a class="highlight"><i>information design</i><div><img class="hidden" src="docs/gl_nyt_01.jpg"></div></a> coming out of the editorial world that make people think about and explore subjects further. I also enjoy opportunities to infuse my work with a playful and intentional voice that makes the user feel personally seen by and engaged with it because it makes the internet feel more human. If you found this site via my portfolio's About section and your company/studio is hiring, <a class="highlight"><i>I would love to find a role</i><div><img class="hidden2" src="docs/WebsiteResume.png"></div></a> that would allow me to engage with the multiplicities of UX/UI design through words- and ideas-centric digital products.</h2>
