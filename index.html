      <h3>Hello &mdash;</h3>
      <h3>I am a digital product designer, visual designer, and former 5th grade teacher in New York City. I have a Master's degree in communication design from Parsons.<h3>
<h3>I love creating things that energize people to explore the world at the ground level, especially if that exploration leads to learning something new or shifting an existing worldview. I feel most energized thinking about how to design for words, stories, and ideas and what that means for the current moment and medium.<h3>

       <p><strong>1. Dinner Party App</strong></p>
       <p>The restaurant model has shifted dramatically over the past year, forcing restaurants to jump through hoops to reinvent their business or otherwise close down. Dinner Party is a resource for restaurants to offer ticketed and curated take-home meal experiences. It connects customers’ desires to support their favorite local restaurants with a platform that elevates the restaurants’ operational systems already in place. <br>
     Dinner Party is a solution to optimize the takeout experience through delight and experimentation. <br>

  <p><strong>2. Collections feature for <i>The New York Times</i></strong></p>
  <p>The goal of this project was to choose a native app, identify a user pain point or opportunity, and come up with a research-driven solution. <br>
I chose the Times’ app because I wanted to explore the relationship between print and digital within the constraints of a company that has a distinct brand presence and voice, and how that’s balanced with content as a design medium, independent from UX. I also wanted to jump into the editorial space to learn more about how editorial meets content curation and the best practices of personalization features.<br>
Shared Collections would act as folders for users to save articles to specific categories within the New York Times app instead of one big list of Saved For Later. Collections would have the ability to be shared internally between subscribers so that users can collaborate with friends on what they read. <br>

  <p><strong>3. Utopia Music Festival</strong></p>
  <p>This project was focused on typography and interaction. The ask was to create a visual identity, website, and app for a music festival around a distinct concept. I worked with one other designer, Yimeng Wang, and our concept was ‘Utopia: What could be?’ The visual identity was inspired by the funky spirit of the city of Stockholm, where the music festival would take place, and a utopian way of life. <br>
The visual identity for Utopia Music Festival was inspired by Swedish design principles and the utopian concept of “what could be.” Using a design system we built, the user experience for the website and app were designed around a hopeful, utopian feeling for a music experience that would take place in Stockholm, Sweden. <br>

  <p><strong>4. Subway Karma <a href="https://subwaykarma.glitch.me"><strong>Game</strong></a></strong></p>
</div>
<p>The web is an accessible plane for exploration that can transcend our collective physical mobility. As a designer, what are the different ways I can create interactions that translate and share experiences?
<br>
In this project, I chose a physical site near me, the subway, and developed an online, interactive experience documenting and ruminating on its uses and misuses.<br>
Subway Karma is a website designed to express the wild card that is the New York City subway. You never know what you’re going to get when you board a train, and I wanted to design an experience that aligns with the chaos that is inevitably going to take place. Subway Karma is a game of memory, coded with jQuery, css, and html.<br>
