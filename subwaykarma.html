<div class="projectdescription">The web is an accessible plane for exploration that can transcend our collective physical mobility. As a designer, what are the different ways I can create interactions that translate and share experiences?
</div>
<div class="projectdescription">
In this project, I chose a physical site near me, the subway, and developed an online, interactive experience documenting and ruminating on its uses and misuses.</div>
<div class="projectdescription">Subway Karma is a website designed to express the wild card that is the New York City subway. You never know what you’re going to get when you board a train, and I wanted to design an experience that aligns with the chaos that is inevitably going to take place. Subway Karma is a game of memory, coded with jQuery, css, and html. </div>
