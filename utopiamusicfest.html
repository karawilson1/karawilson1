<p>This project was focused on typography and interaction. The ask was to create a visual identity, website, and app for a music festival around a distinct concept. I worked with one other designer, Yimeng Wang, and our concept was ‘Utopia: What could be?’ The visual identity was inspired by the funky spirit of the city of Stockholm, where the music festival would take place, and a utopian way of life. </p>
  <p>
The visual identity for Utopia Music Festival was inspired by Swedish design principles and the utopian concept of “what could be.” Using a design system we built, the user experience for the website and app were designed around a hopeful, utopian feeling for a music experience that would take place in Stockholm, Sweden. </p>
<p><i>+ typography, brand identity, design systems, user experience, graphic design — 10 weeks</i></p>
