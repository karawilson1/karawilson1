<div id="description">
<p>The restaurant model has shifted dramatically over the past year, forcing restaurants to jump through hoops to reinvent their business or otherwise close down. Dinner Party is a resource for restaurants to offer ticketed and curated take-home meal experiences. It connects customers’ desires to support their favorite local restaurants with a platform that elevates the restaurants’ operational systems already in place. </p>
  <p>
Dinner Party is a solution to optimize the takeout experience through delight and experimentation. </p>
